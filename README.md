# DS200_Data_Science_Visualization
I did visualization on import-export data between India and China from 2012 to 2016. 
For computation, I used Python over google-colab-notebook.
Analysis of my visualization is given along with notebook.

My primary finding shows a significant trade imbalance, with India heavily reliant on imports from China while its exports to China remain comparatively limited. For further discussion refer to the attached script-notebook.
