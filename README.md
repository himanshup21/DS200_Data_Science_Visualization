# DS200_Data_Science_Visualization
I did visualization on import-export data between India and China from 2012 to 2016, imported from [https://data.gov.in/resource/export-import-goods-china-during-2012-2015-ministry-commerce-industry](https://data.gov.in/resource/export-import-goods-china-during-2012-2015-ministry-commerce-industry). 
For computation, I used Python over google-colab-notebook. Analysis of my visualization is given along with notebook.

My primary finding shows a significant trade imbalance, with India heavily reliant on imports from China while its exports to China remain comparatively limited. For further discussion refer to the attached script-notebook.
